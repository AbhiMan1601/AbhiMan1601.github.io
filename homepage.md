            <p>Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a Statistics Undergrad at University of Alberta, Canada. I am a researcher and developer in the field of Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Economics. Feel free to explore my work and contact me for anything.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="research">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My current research interests are in in the field of Cryptography, Blockchains, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Economics and Algorithmic Information Theory. I am currently involved in two Research Projects as follows :  <ul>
  <li>"A Complex Analytical Proof of the Saint-Venant's Inequality" - with Dr. Arno Berger</li>
  <li>"Stochastic Modelling of fraud prediction in Healthcare and Consensus Protocols in Blockchains using Hidden Markov Models" - at Kouritzin Lab, University of Alberta</li>
</ul>
My work aims to enhance the efficiency, security, and transparency of decentralized systems and their applications in emerging economic, social and artificially intelligent paradigms and use mathematical methods to improve economic and informational security in the digital age.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p><ul>
                <li><h3>Hyperspace Protocol - Protocol Economist</h3> Joined as youngest founding core member of the startup as an economic researcher and engineer working in building a new supercomputer powered by the world's fastest blockchain. I developed working algorithms for the blockchain and modelled the economic incentives and got a chance to work with EigenLayer as an economic integration between Layer 1s. The company is now developing collama.ai. </li>
                <li><h3>Nethermind - Junior Data Scientist</h3> My first job at a tech startup where I had joined as an intern. I was responsible for crunching numbers, figuring out investment decisions and doing Technical Due Diligence for firms like Brevan Howard Digital and others. <i>I co wrote and published the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 5133 for the "Merge", which pushed the date of the difficulty bomb of Ethereum blockchain to 15th September 2022 which happened successfully and I was very lucky to be a part of the group that helped with the historical Merge of Ethereum. I also got cited in the Ethereum Yellow Paper by Dr. Gavin Wood.</i> Other than that, I worked on modelling staking reward analytics for the product Twinstake, an insitutional staking platform with state of the art analytics. 
I was also part of a Merge Watch Party where I briefly talked about the difficulty bomb (12 hours long, good luck): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87HylU9r_Y </li>
